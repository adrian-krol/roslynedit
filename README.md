# RoslynPad

A simple C# editor based on Roslyn and AvalonEdit

## Notes

* This project uses a specially compiled version of Roslyn that exposes some internal members used for completion ("Intellisense") and method signature help
* It's intended only for play and for learning how to use some Roslyn APIs
